# Gym-Sign-Up-Bot
During the pandemic, my University's gyms had 2 hour time slots that opened up 6 hours in advance. As you could imagine, they were very competitive and required 
being on your computer exactly when they dropped. To solve this problem I created a Selenium web bot in Python that uses the Windows Task Manager on the backend
to reserve spots when I want. The bot uses a command line interface to receive parameters such as username, password, date, time and location.
